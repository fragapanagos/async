% update history:
% version 1.0: This one.
%	release 26 April 1991: This one.
%	release 15 April 1991: Did not have \long in \Loop, \_break, and
%		\_continue.
%	release 8 Feb 1991: Used \next instead of \Lp_next.
%	

%%%%%% CODE: (you don't need to read this to use the macros)

{
\catcode`\_=11 % 11 = letter; to make macros private
\globaldefs=1

% Code to supply \fi's:

\def\do_fi{\fi\finish_ifs}

\def\finish_ifs
   {\ifnum\count255>0 %
	 \let\Lp_next=\do_fi
    \else\let\Lp_next=\relax
    \fi
    \advance\count255 by-1 %
    \Lp_next
   }

% The loop (tail-recursion does not clog memory):

\long\def\Loop#1\Pool%
   {\def\Pool{#1\Pool}%
    \Pool
   }

% \Break could have been defined as
%	\def\Break#1#2\Pool{{\count255=#1 \finish_ifs}}
% but this fails if you do
%	\ifnum\count0>5\Break
% without space after the 5: \Break wil be expanded to see if there
% are more digits (and expanding \Break means reading its 2nd argument).
% With the solution below, only \Break is expanded because it starts
% with \relax which is not a number. Using \afterassignment rather
% than passing the number as argument gives better error messages.

\def\Break
   {\relax\afterassignment\_break
    \bgroup\count255=
   }

\long\def\_break#1\Pool%
   {\finish_ifs
    \egroup
   }

\def\Continue
   {\relax\afterassignment\_continue
    \bgroup\count255=
   }

\long\def\_continue#1\Pool%
   {\finish_ifs
    \egroup
    \Pool
   }

} % restore \catcode`\_, \globaldefs
