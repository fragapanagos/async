\section{Variations on Precise Exceptions}

It's not so much about with or without data. 
Either way output $S$ gonna be bundled...

\noindent
The $ste\uparrow$ and $[\neg c]$ events can overlap in time before $ce\uparrow$.
If we moved the $ste\uparrow$ to after the $[\neg c]$, 
we can implement the hse with fewer transistors at the cost of delaying the $ce\uparrow$ event.
