How do I build a switch?

Switches come up in cases like

\begin{csp}
*[[#{C0}->Y!(X0?)
  []#{C1}->Y!(X1?)
 ]]
\end{csp}

where X0 and X1 are passive channels and can become true at any time

\begin{hse}
*[[c0&x0i->yo+;[yi];x0o+;[~x0i];yo-;[~yi];x0o-
  []c1&x1i->yo+;[yi];x1o+;[~x1i];yo-;[~yi];x1o-
 ]]
\end{hse}

Maybe we could avoid this situation entirely by making X0 and X1 active?

\subsection{PRS}

\begin{prs2}
c & xi -> yo+
c & ~xi -> yo-

yi -> xo+
~yi -> xo-
\end{prs2}

Unsure how to convert this to CMOS-implmenetable form.
Will revise the HSE instead.

expand c into ct and cf

\begin{hse}
*[[ct&xi];yo+;[yi];xo+;
  [~cf&~xi];yo-;[~yi];xo-]
\end{hse}

responsible for controlling switch

\begin{hse}

need to make sure that Y completes within the control sequence.
